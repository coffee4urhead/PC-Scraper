### Follow these steps to get the PC-Parts-Scraper application up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
---

### **Client Application Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   You can clone the repository using the following command or download it as a ZIP file and extract it on your
   computer.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coffee4urhead/PC-Parts-Scraper.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   Use the terminal to navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd JobJab
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install all the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Manage settings.py**:  
   List all the apps in the JobJab application by typing in under the INSTALLED_APPS setting - "JobJab.services",
   "JobJab.booking",
   "JobJab.reviews",
   'JobJab.dashboard',
   "JobJab.subscriptions",
   'JobJab.chats',
   You will also need to list the static dir settings STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
   MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [
   os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
   ]

STATICFILES_FINDERS = [
'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'compiledsass')
The project uses Sass Django Compressor that you can configure with these settings: COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS = (
('text/x-scss', 'django_libsass.SassCompiler'),
)
COMPRESS_ENABLED = True
COMPRESS_ROOT = STATIC_ROOT
You will also have to include these dependencies in the INSTALLED_APPS setting: 'compressor',
'pdf2image',
'django_cron',
'channels',
'django.contrib.postgres',

Use POSTGRES for the DB as the project uses psycopg2 as a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It allows Python
applications to interact with PostgreSQL databases efficiently and securely.
Under the MIDDLEWARE settings list the following: 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware', as we are using asgi application in the chats app
Also add CHANNEL_LAYERS setting: CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
"default": {
"BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer"
},
}
FOR AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS I USE THE DEFAULT ONES WITH A SMALL CHANGE - {
'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
'OPTIONS': {'min_length': 10},
},
Here are the redirect url and login url as well as the base AUTH user model settings i use: AUTH_USER_MODEL = '
core.CustomUser'
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
LOGIN_URL = '/user/login/'

i set sessions to age SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 1209600

6. **Prepare Django Stripe**:  
   To integrate Stripe payments into your Django app, follow these steps to create a Stripe account and obtain the
   required credentials (Publishable Key and Secret Key).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Stripe Account Setup

1. **Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)**
2. **Get API Keys**:
    - Test Mode ‚Üí `pk_test_...` (frontend) and `sk_test_...` (backend)
    - Live Mode ‚Üí `pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...` (after verification)
3. **Add to Django Settings**:
   ```python
   # settings.py
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')  # Frontend
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')  # Backend
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')  # Webhooks
4. **Setup Webhooks**:
   For this to work you need to have installed stripe CLI - visit this website to learn more about the installation and
   stripe account login - 'https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli#install'

```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/subscriptions/stripe-webhook/

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/booking/stripe-webhook/ 

   ```

7. **Run the Client Part**:  
   Start the Python Django Framework development server with this command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Open the Project**:  
   Access the application by opening the following URL in a web browser:  
   For other device connections discover your IP address by typing in   ```bash ipconfig ``` then start the server with
   ```bash python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 ``` - this will forward the django website through your IP (Be
   careful because this exposes your actual IP). Then you will access your website at `http://<your-ip-address>:8000/`
   `http://127.0.0.0:8000/`
